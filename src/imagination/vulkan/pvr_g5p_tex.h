/*
 * Apple's A9 GPU (G5P): image-view texture state and sampler words for the
 * pvr_* descriptors. Built only with -Dimagination-g5p-experimental=true.
 *
 * The shape follows G9P's g9p_pack_image_view()/g9p_pack_sampler() (the
 * G9P driver, pvr_arch_g9p_gfx.c): upstream's image, view and sampler objects,
 * with the hardware-facing words replaced by a G5P branch at their call
 * sites. The words themselves are pvr_g5p_tex_encode.h's (included by
 * pvr_arch_g5p_tex.c only: this header is reached from every shared file
 * through pvr_g5p_hooks.h).
 *
 * Descriptor layout the G5P backend reads (PCO_G5P_UPLOAD_IMAGE: 8 dwords
 * at +0; PCO_G5P_UPLOAD_SAMPLER: 2 dwords at +32):
 *   pvr_image_descriptor: words[0..1] = q0, q1; meta[0..1] = q2; meta[2..3]
 *     = 0. The PCO meta upstream writes there is replaced: the G5P backend
 *     doesn't read it.
 *   pvr_sampler_descriptor: words[0] = the general (mip) form; meta[RSVD0,
 *     RSVD1] = the single-level form; everything else 0.
 * Unencodable state leaves the words 0 and logs the reason once; the draw
 * path refuses a draw that uploads it (pvr_g5p_tex_state_valid(),
 * pvr_g5p_sampler_valid()).
