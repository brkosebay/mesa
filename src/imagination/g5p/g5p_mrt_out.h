 * N-target fragment output plan for the G5P (Apple A9) USC backend.
 *
 * Pure data, no NIR, Vulkan or UAPI types, so the same header is used by
 * pco_g5p_general.c and by the host tests (tools/mesa-a9-mrt107/).
 *
 * Evidence (docs/gpu/experiments/gles3-continued107.md section 0.3, Apple's
 * own A9 `metal-tt applegpu_g5p` output, never executed on a device):
 *   - Each 8-bit RGBA colour target takes two consecutive 32-bit output
 *     registers: o(2t) = {g:r}, o(2t+1) = {a:b}, as packed f16 halves.
 *   - One `emitpix` follows the output writes and carries the TOTAL word
 *     count, not a per-target count: 1 target `1c21 0008` (2), 2 targets
 *     `1c41 0008` (4), 4 targets `1c01 0008` (the 3-bit field wraps: field 0
 *     means 8). A mixed set (BGRA8+RGBA8+RGBA16F+R32F) gives `1c71 0008` (7).
 * Only the homogeneous 1/2/4 x 8-bit sets are planned here. Three targets
 * and mixed-format sets have no Apple witness and are refused by name.
 * Where the end-of-tile PBE/EOT side is concerned nothing in this file
 * decides anything: that is capture-gated (g5p_mrt_contract.h).
